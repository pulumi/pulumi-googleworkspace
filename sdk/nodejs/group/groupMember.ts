/**
 * Group Member resource manages Google Workspace Groups Members. Group Member resides under the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group` client scope.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as googleWorkspace from "@pulumi/googleWorkspace";
 *
 * const sales = new googleWorkspace.group.Group("sales", {email: "sales@example.com"});
 * const michael = new googleWorkspace.User("michael", {
 *     primaryEmail: "michael.scott@example.com",
 *     password: "34819d7beeabb9260a5c854bc85b3e44",
 *     hashFunction: "MD5",
 *     name: {
 *         familyName: "Scott",
 *         givenName: "Michael",
 *     },
 * });
 * const manager = new googleWorkspace.group.GroupMember("manager", {
 *     groupId: sales.id,
 *     email: michael.primaryEmail,
 *     role: "MANAGER",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import googleworkspace:group/groupMember:GroupMember manager groups/01abcde23fg4h5i/members/123456789012345678901
